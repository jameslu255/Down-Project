# December 3, 2019 Sprint Planning #

# Summary # 
Down? is an app that allows users to put up small-scale events that will happen within the day. The idea is to let users use Down? as a way to spontaneously meetup and do something together rather than carefully planning when and what is going on like facebook. Users can post events that they are going to be doing (ex. Studying for ECS 189, Playing Video Games: need a player 2!, Getting Raja's: Anyone else down?) and other users will see the events and mark that they are down to join.

# Main Meeting #
## What we did ##
The priority of this sprint was to implement the last features we wanted to be included in the app. We are also prioritizing UI/UX for this sprint before things go into the final product.
We are especially focusing on making sure we can navigate through the screens gracefully.
