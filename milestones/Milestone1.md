# We have pictures of our view controllers. Ask us to show them to you. # 

## Pitch: 
Down? is an app that enables friends to see who is down to hang out. It allows users to make spontaneous plans throughtout the day without having to contact every friend individually.

## Progress:

James: Finished first load screen, login view, login screens and signup screens. Setup the layout of the app. Worked with Jonathan to setup Firebase to work with login/signup. https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-down/tree/Login-View

Jonathan: Studied how to use Firebase. Worked with James to add Firebase functionality to login/signup. https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-down/tree/API-Login-View https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-down/tree/Nov-09-API

Caleb: Made a [custom bottom menu bar view controller](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-down/blob/HomeFeed-ViewController/Down%3F/Down%3F/HomeFeed/BottomMenuBar.swift) for the home screen and began making the the [event feed](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-down/blob/HomeFeed-ViewController/Down%3F/Down%3F/HomeFeed/HomeViewController.swift) on the home screen using a UICollectionView.
